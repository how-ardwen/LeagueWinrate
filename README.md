# LeagueWinrate
Using Riot's League API, calculate winrate of a champ based on game length.
A program coded with a friend for League of Legends.
Finds games played on a champion by NA summoner name and calculates winrate in total, and in different buckets.
Helps reveal how hard a champion "scales."
Uses Riot's APIs, pretty simple.
NOTE: WILL NOT RUN WITHOUT DEVELOPER TOKEN, riot requires tokens to be regenerated daily so this won't run unless you update the token found in Constants.py
